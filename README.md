#### Used to Generate Graduation plans and to compare between catalogs to determine soonest graduation time.

##### You can currently as an User:
* Add classes to your profile
* Choose a catalog from the ones available to generate a schedule from
* Generate several schedules off of different catalogs
* Print the generated schedules for later use
* View Courses currently in CSAS
* View Courses rotation via Course Rotation button on ViewCourses page
* View Catalogs currently in CSAS

##### You can currently as an Admin:
* Add new classes to CSAS on the ViewCourses page
* View classes on the ViewCourses page
* View Courses rotation via Course Rotation button on ViewCourses page
* Add new Catalogs either copying a previous year or an empty catalog on the ViewCatalog page
* View Catalogs on the ViewCatalogs page
* Search for a user on the Admin Search Profile page and generate a schedule on their behalf
* Print a schedule you generated for a student

##### In Progress:
* ~~Add courses to the DB for testing~~
* ~~Add a catalog to the DB for testing~~
* ~~Generate Schedule~~

* ~~Be able to copy an old catalog when making a new catalog~~
* ~~Be able to add a new course~~
* ~~Handle Prereqs for adding a new course~~
* ~~Add Admin controls/interface~~

#### TODO:
* Fill out the About page
* Look at adding ways to handle Electives better (see push "Added note about ELEC Course ID on ViewCourse page")
* Rework the Generate Schedule after changing how electives are handled
* Expand the database to include other majors instead of just Computer Science
* Rework any code that prevents adding other majors to CSAS System
* Change CSAS name
* Change all the ugly Jquery for inserts
* Move the Javascript from on page to their own files and bundle them using MVC bundles
* Handle Admin controls/interface better
* Rework the forms for adding a new catalog and a new course
* Play around more with the Jsgrid library, [there is good documentation for it](http://js-grid.com/docs/)
* Update UI so it isn't quite so cookie cutter ASP.net MVC
